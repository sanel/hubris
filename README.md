# Hubris

Hubris is abbreviation for _Hbase UBeR Interface Shell_ and is [HBase](http://hbase.org) shell
on steroids, providing alternative to quite limited _hbase shell_ command.

## Usage

After archive unpacking, executing

    > <hubris-install-dir>/bin/hubris

would start the shell. Simply add _--help_ to see more options, or type _help_ in shell
to see available commands.

## Installation

To install hubris, simply unpack archive in desired directory. All required files are expected
to be in hubris installation directory, which is true by default.
